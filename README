PHP Bug Lost is a one-file script PHP debug and monitoring console. 
Include it in your script and: send log messages, view SQL queries 
(sends an email to the admin if there's an error), measure times and 
memory usage (sends emails for long loading times or excessive memory 
usage), see all the vars in your scripts and view all your AJAX queries 
(send params and responses).

PHP Bug Lost can run in a console or in a monitor. Use it like a console 
for developing sites to help you in your daily work, and as a monitor for 
production sites for controlling errors, load times and memory usage. 
Find those bugs!

PHP Bug Lost is free, open source. At the moment I'm experimenting with it, 
trying new features, thinking what is good and what not... etc. let me know 
if you found any bug or see a better way to do anything.
